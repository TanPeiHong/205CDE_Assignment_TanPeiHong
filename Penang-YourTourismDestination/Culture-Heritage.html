		<h2>CULTURE & HERITAGE</h2>
		
		<h3>HERITAGE ZONES</h3>
		
		<p>The George Town UNESCO World Heritage Site features Malaysia’s best restored and re-adaptive traditional architecture as well as a multitude of heritage trades and
		arts.</p>
		<p>The world-renowned ‘Street of Harmony’ reflects the influence of the diverse communities that have made Penang their home. At only 2.5sq km, the George Town World
		Heritage Site is compact enough to be explored on foot, bicycle or trishaw.</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"><b>Landmarks</b></p>
		<img src="Images/Landmarks.jpg">
		<p>Topping many must-visit lists, Penang is probably Malaysia’s most well-known tourist destination. Made from a heady mix of culture, art, food and nature, Penang
		engages the mind and senses in a way that no other place can.</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<img src="Images/Landmarks1.jpg">
		<p>Experience its mouth-watering cuisine, breathtaking heritage architecture, quirky art spots and relaxing beaches. Penang is a feast in many ways for any vistor who
		is looking to be awed by the authentic taste of Asia.</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<img src="Images/Landmarks2.jpg">
		<p>Penang’s attractions are aplenty. Here are some of the best ones that should not be missed!</p>
		
		<br /><br />
		<hr />
		<br />
		
		<h3>STREET ART</h3>
		
		<p>Life in Penang is a rich blend of Malay, Chinese, Indian, Peranakan and European influences. Heritage isn’t confined to museums and can be found thriving along the
		city’s five-foot ways – thus providing a vibrant living celebration of George Town’s UNESCO World Heritage status. You’ll experience a spirit of authenticity and joy
		in its traditional festivals, stunning architecture, spontaneous street art and old-world charm.</p>
		<p>Penang’s quirky murals and street art have made international headlines. Around every street corner is a work of art waiting to be discovered!</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"><b>Wall Murals</b></p>
		<img src="Images/Wall_Murals.jpg">
		<p>Penang as a free port once teemed with foreign merchants that traded not only wares but their culture. This exchange of world views made Penang an exciting
		cosmopolitan city back then and modern day Penang is no different. Only this time, the draw is not trade but art!</p>
		<p>Ever since George Town Festival commissioned Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic to create 6 wall murals in 2012, George Town’s street art scene has never been the
		same again. Zacharevic shot to international fame with his murals and George Town’s walls in turn have acted as a canvas to some of the most interactive artworks the
		city has seen.</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<img src="Images/Wall_Murals1.jpg">
		<p>Some might even say that certain iconic wall murals have gained so much recognition that they are on par with other Penang cultural landmarks like the KOMTAR
		building or Penang Ferry. This artistic boom has opened many doors for local and international artists, nspiring many others to unleash their creativity on the walls
		of Penang’s buildings.</p>
		
		<br /><br />

		<h3>PLACES OF WORSHIP</h3>
		<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"><b>Places of Worship</b></p>
		<img src="Images/Worship.jpg">
		<p>The island’s history as a trading port for the British East India company brought in many workers and traders from all over the world. In addition to the major
		races – Chinese, Malay and Indian, there is also a sizeable community of Eurasian and Siamese communities in Penang. They brought along with them their respective
		beliefs and rituals.</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<img src="Images/Worship1.jpg">
		<p>The state has practised religious tolerance from then till now with its diverse places of worship, some of which are built very close to each other. The prefect
		example is Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling, also known as the Street of Harmony where the Kapitan Keling Mosque, Goddess of Mercy Temple, St. George's Church and Sri Maha
		Mariamman Temple all sit within walking distance.</p>
